# Sampling-Theory-Illustrator
## Desktop Appilcation - Written in Python (pyqt5)
Developing an illustrator for signal recovery process, showing importance and validation of the Nyquist rate.
# Features
- Browsing mid-length signal.
- Sampling up to 3 times the maximum frequency.
- Reconstructing the signal from the sampled points (shown on top of main signal graph).
 Shown as dotted signal on top of origial signal and in separate graph below whose visibility can be toggled.
- Composing signal out of sinusoidals with user-defined parameters (frequency, amplitude & phase) and saving it to for usage.
- Adding new sinusoidals and removing added ones from user-defined signal.
- Controlling relative size of signal sampling/reconstruction and signal composer windows via a splitter.
- Resizing/rescaling window.
